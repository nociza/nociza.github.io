# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using Gatsby and hosted on Github Pages. 

## Development

To run the website locally, see commands in `package.json`.

## Why Gatsby?

I wanted to build a personal website since 2019 and spent way too long figuring out the "best" js framework for making static web pages and ended up choosing one randomly and sticking to it. In the end, it took less than a day to complete the entire website.

There are some weird dependency issues, especially with the Sharp plugin, but it's usable and it has all the features I need.
